/**
 * T28 / R22 — the universal direction wrapper.
 *
 * ONE wrapper + ONE hook, both fed by the app language. This is the entire
 * public surface a product app needs:
 *
 *   - <DirectionProvider lang={lang}>  — wraps the app ONCE. Applies
 *     `direction` to a flex:1 View; every logical property inside
 *     (start/end, marginStart, flex-start, plain 'row') mirrors
 *     automatically via Yoga inheritance. No per-component work.
 *
 *   - useDirection()                    — for the two things Yoga does NOT
 *     inherit: isRTL-keyed logic (mirrored icons) and explicit textAlign.
 *     Returns values derived from the LANGUAGE, never from I18nManager —
 *     T10 measured that `isRTL` does not follow `direction`, and R1/T2
 *     measured the flag being wrong on both platforms anyway.
 *
 * Measured basis: `direction` works on Android Fabric (T10/R16) and on iOS
 * Fabric (T10, this repo, iPhone 16 Pro Max) — the only direction primitive
 * verified on both. forceRTL + reload is not portable (R22).

   * textAlign resolves DIFFERENTLY on each platform (T30d):
   *
   *   Android: the island's direction.
   *   iOS:     always physically LEFT — not the island, not the script, and
   *            not the app's own direction (measured identical in a natively
   *            forced-RTL build), so a Hebrew label lands on the LEFT.
   *
   * Identical code, correct on Android, wrong on iOS, invisible to a
   * Hebrew-only review done on an Android device.

   * is NOT mirrored by the island: it resolves alignment in the platform's own
   * text widget rather than through Yoga, so the physical value survives.
   *
   * Measured (T30b, one island, one property, two elements):
   *
   *   <Text>      textAlign 'left' -> renders RIGHT (mirrored by Yoga)
   *   <TextInput> textAlign 'left' -> renders LEFT  (not mirrored)
   *
   * This is the trap that produced the rule: one hook value fed a label and an
   * input on the same screen, the input rendered correctly, and its
   * correctness hid the label's error.
   *
   * Always-LTR data — a phone, an email, an IBAN, an id — also wants a
   * physical value, and in a <Text> that means 'right' inside RTL (Yoga
   * mirrors it to the start edge). Pair it with a BiDi isolate either way:
   * this pins the block, the isolate fixes character order (§4).

  //     textAlign: dir === 'rtl' ? 'right' : 'left'   // WRONG for <Text>
  //
  // typed 'left' | 'right' and documented as "for text that must hug the
  // reading edge". It is the double flip: Yoga has already mirrored the
  // subtree, so 'right' mirrors a second time and lands the text on the wrong
  // edge (R30/T30, both platforms). The value is correct only for a
  // <TextInput>, which is not mirrored — which is why the two are now separate
  // fields with separate names. The original bug in this project came from
  // exactly this conflation.
  //
  // No `key` remount needed, and this is now measured on BOTH platforms.
  //
  // T29 row G mutates `direction` on an already-mounted node; row H forces a
  // remount with key={dir}. Both track the toggle, on identical coordinates:
  //
  //   Android  G tracks  ->  mutation applies to a live node
  //   iOS      G 81..524 (ltr) -> 795..1238 (rtl), same as H
  //
  // So the theory that `direction` binds only at node creation — which is what
  // the key={dir} workaround existed to defend against — is disproven on both.
  // H gains nothing. See RESULTS.md T29.
  //
  // This is the one place `direction` behaves better than forceRTL, which does
  // need surface recreation.
